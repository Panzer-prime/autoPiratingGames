# autoPiratingGames

# V: 1.0.0

# About

I have made a simple bot that can auto-pirate games from Steaunlocked. the app is simple you download the code and then run 

```
node app.js
```
Enter the game name in the console and wait that the app would go into Google to search for the game + Steam unlocked then press the buttons needed and wait

# Why I did it 

got bored and said why not 

# BTW 

you need to go and modify the path to chrome and only chrome (it doesn't work )
